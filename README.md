# Architect
Architect is a Hollow Knight mod allowing you to add platforms, enemies and more to change areas in the game.

You can make these changes with the **in-game editor**, and can share them with your friends in multiplayer using HKMP.

Architect has a wide range of objects to place down and configuration settings to use, allowing for lots of creativity!

You can find the full documentation for Architect [here](https://starshooter.gitbook.io/architect).
